# CrossModel Merge Extension - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The CrossModel Merge extension is a production-ready VS Code extension that provides 3-way merge capabilities for CrossModel files. It is built on Langium AST reflection and integrates with the existing CrossModel language server infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

- Schema-agnostic 3-way merge using Langium AST reflection
- Reference-aware identity resolution (direct and nested `$refText` support)
- Hierarchical tree view with auto-refresh on Git state changes
- Smart label generation using reference text
- Performance-optimized to parse only Git-tracked changed files
- Robust circular reference handling in tooltips

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Type System** (`src/types/`)
   - `change.ts`: Defines the Change data structure used throughout the system
   - `langium-bridge.d.ts`: Bridge interface to the CrossModel serializer

2. **Reflection Layer** (`src/reflection/`)
   - `discover.ts`: Discovers properties of AST nodes using Langium reflection
   - `ids.ts`: Resolves stable identities for nodes (prefers IdentifiedObject.id)
   - `hints.ts`: Provides optional hints for UX improvements

3. **Diff Engine** (`src/diff3/`)
   - `diff-values.ts`: 3-way diff for scalar properties with conflict detection
   - `diff-nodes.ts`: Recursive 3-way diff for AST nodes

4. **Apply Engine** (`src/apply/`)
   - `apply.ts`: Applies selected changes to AST, mutating in-place

5. **I/O Layer** (`src/io/`)
   - `git-io.ts`: Git operations using VS Code Git API
   - `parse.ts`: Parse CrossModel files using Langium services
   - `emit.ts`: Serialize AST using the existing CrossModel serializer
   - `fs.ts`: File system operations using WorkspaceEdit

6. **UI Layer** (`src/ui/`)
   - `tree.ts`: Tree view provider with checkbox support
   - `commands.ts`: Command implementations

7. **Extension Entry** (`src/extension.ts`)
   - Extension activation and command registration

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Schema-Agnostic Design

The extension uses Langium's runtime reflection instead of hard-coded property lists. This means:

- No maintenance needed when the grammar evolves
- Automatic support for new properties/sections
- Type-safe via Langium's AstReflection API

```typescript
const props = discoverProps(node, reflection, hints);
// Returns: { scalars, singletons, arrays }
```

### 2. Identity-Based Reconciliation

Identity is determined by:

1. First, check for `node.id` from IdentifiedObject interface
2. Check if hint defines a custom `keyProp`
3. Check for `name` or `label` properties
4. Check if first property is a reference with `$refText` (direct or nested via `value`)
5. Synthesize from `$type` and visible scalar properties

This ensures stable identity across versions and supports nodes without explicit IDs.

```typescript
const id = resolveId(node, hint);
// Prefers node.id, then reference text, falls back to synthesized key
```

**Reference Handling**: For nodes like `AttributeMappingSource` or `AttributeMapping` that primarily contain references, the identity is based on the referenced object's text (`$refText`). This handles both direct references and nested references (e.g., `attribute.value.$refText`).

### 3. Integration with Existing Serializer

The extension **does not** implement custom YAML/text generation. Instead, it uses the existing CrossModel serializer:

```typescript
const services = getCrossModelServices();
const serializer = services.CrossModel.serializer.Serializer;
const text = serializer.serialize(root, uri.toString());
```

This ensures:

- Consistent formatting with the language server
- No duplicate serialization logic
- Automatic support for grammar changes

### 4. Conflict Detection

Conflicts are detected per property:

```
conflict iff (ours !== base) && (theirs !== base) && (ours !== theirs)
```

Conflicts are:

- Marked in the UI with ⚠️
- Unchecked by default
- Can be resolved via "Accept All Ours/Theirs" commands

### 5. Unordered Set Reconciliation

Child arrays are treated as unordered sets, keyed by identity:

- Add detection: in ours or theirs but not in base
- Remove detection: in base but not in ours or theirs
- Update detection: in all three but with differences

## Implementation Details

### AST Property Discovery

Properties are categorized into three types:

1. **Scalars**: Primitives, nulls, references

   ```typescript
   scalars.set('name', 'EntityName');
   ```

2. **Singletons**: Single child nodes

   ```typescript
   singletons.set('target', targetObjectNode);
   ```

3. **Arrays**: Arrays of child nodes

   ```typescript
   arrays.set('attributes', [attr1, attr2, attr3]);
   ```

### Change Tree Structure

Changes form a tree:

```typescript
interface Change {
   id: string; // Stable identity
   nodeKind: NodeKind; // e.g., 'LogicalEntity'
   fileUri: Uri;
   kind: ChangeKind; // add | remove | update | rename
   details?: Record<string, PropDelta>; // Property deltas
   conflicts?: boolean; // Any property conflict?
   children?: Change[]; // Nested changes
   label?: string; // UI label
   range?: Range; // Location in file (line numbers from CST)
}
```

The `range` property captures the location of the AST node in the source file by extracting it from Langium's `$cstNode.range`. This enables precise navigation to changes and displaying line numbers in the UI.

### 3-Way Diff Algorithm

For each node:

1. Determine change kind (add/remove/update)
2. Diff scalar properties
3. Recursively diff singleton children
4. Reconcile array children as unordered sets
5. Detect conflicts per property
6. Extract location information from `$cstNode.range` (Langium's 0-based line/character positions)
7. Build Change tree with range annotations

### Apply Algorithm

For each selected change:

1. Start from Ours AST
2. For updates: apply property changes
3. For adds: deep-clone from Theirs (not fully implemented)
4. For removes: delete by identity
5. Recurse for child changes
6. Serialize modified AST
7. Apply to filesystem via WorkspaceEdit

## Usage

### Commands

- **Preview Diff**: 2-way diff (HEAD vs working tree)

```
crossmodel.previewDiff
```

- **Merge from Ref**: 3-way merge with target branch

```
crossmodel.mergeFromRef
```

- **Apply Selected**: Apply checked changes

```
crossmodel.applySelected
```

- **Submit Changes**: Commit and push

```
crossmodel.submitChanges
```

- **Show Raw Diff**: Opens Git's native diff view for a specific change (inline button on tree items)

```
crossmodel.showRawDiff
```

- **Refresh Changes**: Recompute the current view

```
crossmodel.refreshChanges
```

- **Accept All Ours**: Accept our version for all conflicts

```
crossmodel.acceptAllOurs
```

- **Accept All Theirs**: Accept their version for all conflicts

```
crossmodel.acceptAllTheirs
```

### Configuration

```json
{
   "crossmodelMerge.modelGlob": "**/*.cm",
   "crossmodelMerge.git.targetRef": ""
}
```

## Integration Points

### CrossModel Services

The extension imports services from `@crossmodel/server`:

```typescript
import { createCrossModelServices } from '@crossmodel/server';
const services = createCrossModelServices({ connection: undefined });
```

Required from services:

- `services.CrossModel.reflection.AstReflection` - for property discovery
- `services.CrossModel.serializer.Serializer` - for text generation
- `services.shared.workspace.*` - for document management

### Git Integration

Uses VS Code Git API with fallback mechanisms:

```typescript
const gitExtension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('vscode.git');
const git = await gitExtension.activate();
const api = git.getAPI(1);
```

Operations:

- Get merge base
- Read files at specific refs (with direct `git show` fallback)
- Get current HEAD commit
- Track repository state changes for auto-refresh
- Get changed files (working tree + staged)

**Auto-Refresh**: The extension listens to Git repository state changes and automatically refreshes the diff view when files are modified, staged, or unstaged (only in diff mode, not during 3-way merges).

**Optimized File Discovery**: Only parses Git-tracked changed files (via `repo.state.workingTreeChanges` and `indexChanges`) instead of scanning all workspace files, significantly improving performance for large workspaces.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testable Functions

Pure functions suitable for unit testing:

- `resolveId(node, hint)` - identity resolution
- `diffScalarProps(base, ours, theirs, hidden)` - scalar diff
- `hasConflicts(details)` - conflict detection
- `isEqual(a, b)` - deep equality check

### Integration Testing

Areas requiring integration tests:

- Parse → Diff → Apply → Serialize round-trip
- Git operations with real repositories
- UI interactions with checkboxes
- Command execution flows

## UI Enhancements

### Hierarchical Tree View

Changes are displayed in a hierarchical folder structure instead of a flat list:

```
ExampleDWH/
  └─ entities/
      └─ CalcAge.entity.cm
          └─ update: Entity
              └─ update: description
```

This is implemented by parsing file paths and building a tree of `FolderNode` and `ChangeNode` types.

### Smart Label Generation

Labels are generated with the following priority:

1. **id property** if present (e.g., `Mapping:CustomerMapping`)
2. **First property's reference** if it's a Langium reference with `$refText`:
   - Direct: `AttributeMappingSource.value.$refText` → "Customer.First_Name"
   - Nested: `AttributeMapping.attribute.value.$refText` → "Name"
   - Entity: `TargetObject.entity.$refText` → "CompleteCustomer"
3. **Type name** as fallback (e.g., "AttributeMapping")

This makes the tree much more readable, showing "CompleteCustomer" instead of "Target", or "Name" instead of "AttributeMapping".

### Tooltip Information

Hovering over a change shows:

- Change kind (ADD/UPDATE/REMOVE)
- Node type
- Property changes with base/ours/theirs values
- Conflict warning if applicable

**Circular Reference Handling**: The tooltip generation safely handles AST nodes with circular references (via `$container`) by:

- Detecting AST nodes with `$type` property
- Showing concise representation like `Entity:CustomerName`
- Falling back to `[Complex Object]` for other circular structures

### Auto-Refresh

The extension automatically refreshes the diff view when:

- Files are modified in the editor
- Files are staged/unstaged in Git
- The working tree state changes

This is achieved by listening to `repo.state.onDidChange` events from the Git extension.

### Show Raw Diff Button

Each change item in the tree has an inline "Show Raw Diff" button that:

- Opens the Git extension's native diff view (via `git.openChange` command)
- Shows the same diff view as clicking on files in the Git Changes panel
- Includes line number information in the title for non-root changes (e.g., "file.cm:15-20")
- Automatically scrolls to and selects the specific change location when possible
- Falls back to `vscode.diff` if the Git command is unavailable

**Implementation Details**:

- Each `Change` object tracks its location via the `range` property (extracted from Langium's `$cstNode.range`)
- Langium's CST ranges are 0-based (line and character)
- The button only appears on change items, not folder nodes
- Uses `viewItem` context matching to show button inline: `viewItem =~ /^change-/`

## Known Limitations

1. **Add Operations**: Require access to theirs AST node (not fully implemented in apply.ts)
2. **Rename Detection**: Root node renames not yet implemented
3. **Validation**: Post-merge validation not fully integrated
4. **Performance**: No caching for repeated operations (though optimized to only parse changed files)
5. **UI**: No graphical diff viewer (tree view only)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full Add Support**: Pass theirs nodes through Change structure
2. **Rename Detection**: Detect when node identity changes
3. **Validation Integration**: Re-parse and validate after merge
4. **Performance**: Cache ASTs per (uri, ref)
5. **Graphical Diff**: Side-by-side diff viewer
6. **Undo/Redo**: Command history for merge operations
7. **Merge Strategies**: Pluggable conflict resolution strategies
8. **Partial Application**: Apply subset of changes to single file
