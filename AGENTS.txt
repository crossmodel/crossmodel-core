# Agent Guidelines

- Use **npm** as the package manager for this repository. Do not reintroduce Yarn lockfiles or commands.
- Update documentation and scripts to stay in sync with npm-based workflows when you change tooling or commands.
- Prefer workspace-aware commands such as `npm run --workspace <package> <script>` when targeting sub-packages.
- Run the relevant `npm run` scripts and tests that cover the areas you change before opening a pull request.
